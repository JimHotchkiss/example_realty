<!-- HTML Images: you have to be explicit about where the
image is.  You have to tell the browser the exact path to
the image.  This is also case-sensitive.  Example:
foldername/ = "go inside folder"
../ - will leave the current folder and go to the parent folder
each to you ../ = you are going up a level, and is always
relevant to the file you are currently on
"alt" text reads aloud an image description to visually
impaired users.  It's also important for search engines-->

<!-- links <a>= 'anchor link' href='hyper-reference'
The first links are internal links, and take you to somewhere on the
website, and this is referred to as the 'relevant path'.  External
links take you to an external link.  This is referred to as the 'absolute path'
